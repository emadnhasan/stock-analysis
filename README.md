# stock-analysis

## Overview of Project
See the impact of refactoring on run time

### Purpose
Create a stock analysis and determine if refactoring has an impact on run time.
	
## Results
As can be seen, refactoring did have an impact on run times![2017 Analysis](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100659114/159203504-54330e5f-236a-4f21-b8a8-5a10b67f578b.png)

## Summary
Refactoring code has both advantages and disadvantages. Some pros of refactoring are: it leads to faster run time for the code, minimizes bugs, and it makes the code cleaner and easier to read. Some cons are: it does not offer any real additional funtionality, it can make the code more complex for a new user to read, and it could be more difficult to debug. These factors should be kept in mind when deciding whether or not refactoring is necessary.
